# Hello world!

This file is intended to practice a little bit our skills on **GitHub**. I will ask you some questions and you can answer it with the truth or playing with fantasy answers. The questions are not intended to steal your password (but this is _exactly_ what a person trying to steal your password would say ðŸ‘€). I hope you enjoy the task.

- What's your name? **Joanna**
- What did you have for dinner yesterday? *Honest Greens*
- What's the color of your shoes? **black**
- Where do you want your next trip to be? #Sweden

Great! You accomplished your task ðŸŽ‰. Now save this file and follow the remaining instructions.
